        "description": "Lit the Light Trust is a registered Nonprofit organization exclusively working for the betterment of visually impaired persons, It is a volunteer-driven organization involving youth volunteerism more than 2000+ volunteers are engaged every year for helping visually challenged people in Scribing, Audio recording, Identifying Hidden talents & promoting special skills, Inclusive job placement and career development.\n\n\n**It was the vision of a single person, S.N. Barath**, that sparked this endeavor. After attending reading sessions for a year, a visually impaired student of Government High School in Poonamalle scored 960 in his class 12 board examination. This was an eye-opener for Barath. He now realised that a little help could go a long way in helping such students.\n\nIn 2014, along with a few of his colleagues **RamKumar & Ravikant** joined hands in this journey of social Service. Lit the Light **formed as a volunteer group from 26th Jan, 2014.** This organization is actively involved in the empowerment of the Visually Impaired. Officially registered as charitable trust with Tamilnadu Government in **2017.**",

Rajkumar received his basic education from St Louis school for visually challenged and later graduated in English from Loyola College. He is an inspiration to aspiring youngsters who like to learn and expand their ring of knowledge. Rajkumar spent his time preparing for interviews with his association with Lit the light career team.  Rajkumar spent hours updating himself on current affairs and he enrolled himself in various employment forums. He was offered a job by Iteria.us Hyderabad as an Accessibility tester, development of testing system tools.

            "name": "Hello All,\n\n\nOnce again...Welcome to Lit the Light's Coordinator aka Leads Blog Series. Today we want to present the testimony of our coordinator “Mrs. Usha” sharing her experience and moments with Lit the Light in simple words.  She is here to express herself on \"What?... How?... Why?... and few more questions on dedicating her time, volunteering with Lit the Light\"…in her own words.\n\n\nThese testimonies are considered as an assessment of Lit the Light’s performance and work on improvement suggestions (if any) from our Leads, who have been part of us during our ups and downs. To continue with... Here's our Mrs. Usha, a dedicated coordinator, a valuable team lead, supporting us with scribe requests, as a reader, and also in many other field activities as well.\n\n \nLit the Light's Coordinator Mrs. Usha’s words on travel with us…\n\n\n### Can u tell us a little bit about yourself?\nHi, I’m Usha and I am a homemaker. I spend a lot of my time reading and listening to music!\n\n### How did you hear about LTL and why did you decide to start volunteering here?\nI have a daughter and I’ve spent most of my life being busy taking care of her. When she went off to college, I finally had time for myself and felt like it was time for me to do something meaningful (I was never particularly interested in watching tv serials anyway!). A few years back, I had read an article about Lit the Light in a newspaper and was really impressed with their work, so I cut the newspaper article and kept it aside to contact them after my daughter went off to college. I finally called up Mr.Barath and asked him how I could offer my support to help the visually impaired. Ever since that call, I have been coordinating, assigning, and managing work between volunteers and students. I constantly ask for feedback and suggestions on ways to improve our services from the students themselves. Now, with the COVID-19 pandemic severely affecting the lifestyle of the visually impaired students, I have received several calls from students personally asking me for help and support. But thanks to the help of our team of volunteers, we were able to gather all the details and managed to handle it smoothly.\n\n### What aspects of being a volunteer do you like the most? What is your most memorable experience volunteering here?\nThe joy of doing something for somebody without expecting anything in return is simply magical. Just a simple \"thank you\" from these students is rewarding enough. Every moment that I have spent volunteering with LTL has been memorable because I have realized that spending my time and energy to help these students doesn’t just make the world better, It has made me a better person as well. It has boosted my happiness, health, and my overall sense of well-being.\n\n### Do you have any message for anyone who wants to join us at LTL?\nMy message is simple-Just do whatever you can, however small, to give back to society. If you think you don’t have the time, that’s okay! Lit the light is very flexible, you can offer help from the comforts of your own home. Try to spare just a few hours to really make a difference in someone’s life. You have the education and resources to help those in need, please use it.\n\n\nLit the Light thanks Usha and appreciates her for her time and support for the upliftment of the Visually Challenged community in every possible way...Lit the Light takes the opportunity, rather proud to brag that Usha is one of the indispensable backbones of our organization, and a role model for many other volunteers. Thanks again Usha, for your time…support…and most of all, for being part of Lit the Light’s Team.\n\nCompiled by **Nandita Vaidyanathan, LTL Volunteer**",

Today we want to present the testimony of our coordinator “Mr. Yukesh” sharing his experience and moments with Lit the Light in simple words.  He is here to express himself on \"What?... How?... Why?... and few more questions on dedicating his time, volunteering with Lit the Light\"…in his own words.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese testimonies are considered as an assessment of Lit the Light’s performance and work on improvement suggestions (if any) from our Leads, who have been part of us during our ups and downs. To continue with... Here's our Mr. Yukesh, a dedicated coordinator, a valuable team lead, supporting us with scribe requests, as a reader, and also in many other field activities too in our Madurai, Tamil Nadu area.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Lit the Light's Coordinator Mr. Yukesh’s words on travel with us…\r\n\r\n**Can u tell us a little bit about yourself?**\r\nHey, I’m Yukesh! I’m from Madurai but I’ve been working as a PCB design engineer in Coimbatore for the past 4 years. Apart from engaging myself in social work, I enjoy hanging out with my friends and playing video games! I’m also very passionate about music and play the guitar.\r\n\r\n \r\n**How did you hear about LTL and why did you decide to start volunteering here?**\r\nIn 2015, I came across an LTL post on WhatsApp, intrigued by the work done by the organization I had contacted Mr. Barath, the founder of LTL. However, seeing that the organization was mainly based in Chennai, I was not able to help out. In 2016, after having graduated from college, I got a call from Mr. Barath saying that they would like to extend their work to Madurai as well and was wondering if I would like to be in charge of coordinating the services here. I was very keen about saying yes, however, I told him that I didn’t know how to go about it. Barath offered to help me out and constantly guided me through the process. I first approached the ‘Indian Association for Blind’ and the ‘St. Joseph Blind Trust’ in Madurai to offer them my support. They were so grateful for our support as they said that there were very few people who volunteered and had the teachers themselves scribe for the students. I am happy to say that within a period of four years, we were able to see significant growth in the number of volunteers in both schools and colleges.\r\n\r\n**What aspects of being a volunteer do you like the most?**\r\nThe students would often tell me that before we started helping them out, they would not be able to even think about studying for their exams as they were tensed about looking for people who would volunteer to scribe for them. Now, they feel like they don’t have to worry about finding a scribe and could put all their energy into studying as they are confident, we will arrange one. Just a simple ‘thank you I receive from these students, fills my heart with joy and motivates me to continue doing my best for the Visually Challenged Community. \r\n\r\n**What is your most memorable experience volunteering with LTL?**\r\nEvery minute I spend interacting with these students and listening to their stories is memorable. Their positive energy is very palpable and the sheer joy I see on their faces after aiding them with their exams fills me up to the brim with happiness. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Do you have any message for anyone who wants to join us at LTL?**\r\nFirstly, you need to remember that your personal life will be affected and that there might be times you might feel like there is no time for you to volunteer. But time shouldn’t be a factor at all because you can always make time to help these students out. For instance, I work nearly 17 hours a day and get an average of 4 hours of sleep, but I make it a point to devote some time to volunteering. Secondly, try to really listen to the needs and wants of each individual. I would ask the students which tone and style of reading they are most comfortable with and accordingly coordinate with the volunteers. Feedback is always important! our motto I try to run by is \"No one can help everyone but everyone can help someone\", this drives me to do my part in bettering the community, and hope it drives you too.\r\n\r\nLit the Light thanks Yukesh and appreciates him for his time and support for the upliftment of the Visually Challenged community in every possible way...Lit the Light takes the opportunity, rather proud to brag that Yukesh is one of the indispensable backbones of our organization, who is instrumental in helping us spread our wings in Madurai and adjoining areas… and a role model for many other volunteers. Thanks again Yukesh, for your time…support…and most of all, for being part of Lit the Light’s Team.\r\n\r\nCompiled by Nandita Vaidyanathan, LTL Volunteer ",

            "description": "**Open up a Brave new world through your eyes**\n\nYour words can open doors of virtual eyesight to visually challenged. Lit the light is an organization created by volunteers for a noble cause to support the visually challenged. Let’s travel into the life of a child with visual challenge from birth. Recently I read a tutor material for a group of visually challenged teachers who are trainers to train visually challenged children. It’s a great effort to understand, comprehend and live a normal life to accustom to the open world. Initial years are spent on learning basic life skill training to manage their chores then children with partial eyesight or no sight learn through braille system till they turn 12-14 years. Only limited Braille books and Braille kits are available at our libraries and at schools hence there is a need for readers to support them to pursue high school or university studies.\n\nThe team of volunteers at Lit the light started preparing audio books to enable visually challenged school children and students at the university. Reading study material for students preparing for competitive examinations, recording voice over from school textbooks, magazines, stories and preparing volumes of audio for students interested in higher education are a few activities organized by the Lit the light team. Volunteers across the globe are connected through coordinators and study material is distributed after ‘chunking’ into a few units, after recording its compiled and shared with libraries at Lit the light centers at Chennai, Coimbatore, Madurai, Trichy and later distributed to students from various towns , villages who depend on audio version to prepare for exams. Recording is done in English as well as Tamil. The unique features of The Lit the light sessions are centralized method of collection, storage, distribution and simplifying English material through easy explanations in Tamil.  The lit the light team is associated with centers at Porur , Anna  centenary braille library, St Louis school at Adyar,NIVH at poonamallee and readers travel across the city to meet students at university , hostel and school campus to read at their convenience during examinations. The team of volunteers coordinate between students and readers to meet and utilize their services. \n\nIn order to create an awareness among the public to encourage more volunteers join the team Lit the light organizes ‘Read fest’ every year at Chennai with unique thematic ideas. 200 new volunteers read to 200 students for 2 hours was 2019 event at Chennai, In March 2020 at Madurai it was 150 :150 fresh volunteers: visually challenged. These events create awareness as well as provides a platform for new volunteers to obtain ‘Hands on’ experience to adjust on voice modulation, reading speed according to the needs of student. Though a lot of prerecorded AI materials are available in the market the students with visual challenges feel that live reading, planned recording with simple explanations prepared by Lit the light team is more effective and useful.",

            "description": "Every exam season, the visually impaired students have yet another challenge to tackle besides putting in their best efforts. Finding a scribe at the right time and being able to successfully complete their exams. Visually challenged students completely rely on scribes to write exams for them and most often the onus on finding a scribe falls on the students themselves. There aren’t many standard frameworks or systems to regulate scribe supply other than for a few government exams and students end up having to grapple to get hold of a good scribe for every approaching exam. This continuous search for scribes for every exam season, be it competitive exams, academic exams like model tests, semester exams and so on it's a huge strain on the students' psyche and affects their overall performance. Students have to deal with a lot of uncertainties starting from availability of good scribes, their on time presence at exam and the level of expertise a scribe has in being able to assist the student appropriately.\n\nPeople with disabilities in general lack the social capacity to search for eligible scribes and more often even the scribes who have been scheduled to appear may not turn up at the last moment. The unavailability of scribes, mostly written off as a minor inconvenience, can actually be a deal breaker for many aspiring visually impaired students and exam candidates. There is also a need for proper rapport and communication between the student and the scribe which if lacking can affect the student’s performance.\n\nWhen The many attempts to get a proper scribe is in itself a big challenge, many visually impaired students get discouraged to continue their studies and may also drop out of exams given the inconveniences caused.\n\nAt Lit the Light, we understand the plight of our visually challenged students and have been trying our best to assist our students in their search for reliable scribes. We have been arranging scribes and reading assistance to students ever since our inception. Every year we manage to satisfy more than 5000 scribe requests for a varied range of exams like semester exams, model exams, online and offline competitive exams for bank jobs and government jobs and so on. Our Health & Family Welfare department reports that the prevalence of blindness is 4 per 1000 population just in the state of Tamil Nadu that could count to thousands of visually impaired students and aspirants who are in need of quality scribe assistance every year.\n\nOur visually impaired brethren are no less capable to perform like the rest of us. Giving them the equal opportunity they deserve can help them realise their potential and perform their best. Let us join hands to make scribing easy and more accessible so every visually impaired student studies well without the added stress of having to search for a scribe for every exam they take.\n",

Audio books are considered a highly preferable means to provide books to persons with Visual challenge as unlike Braille books that can go up to several volumes per book. Audio book has always been a popular medium among visually challenged students because only this kind book helps them study without other people's assistance and much easier for these students to get access to than others, since these are accessible through any medium like, computers, mobile phones, etc.\n\nOur Audio books recording volunteers are from different parts of the world, like United States, United Kingdom, Bahrain/Middle East and our own India. Categories or languages we record are Tamil, English, English reading with explanation in Tamil, rarely in Hindi and Telugu too depending on the requirement.  Our volunteers groups are maintained in WhatsApp by the Audiobook leads. Lead volunteers, compile and maintain the recorded files in the drive.  Lit the Light is working towards Audio book library in our website for the students easy access.\n\nLit the Light appreciates all our dedicated volunteers, who have been supporting us with audio books.  We value their priceless time spent on recording, every time on-time and high quality. Lit the Light acknowledges leads and coordinators our audiobook activity\n\n- Karthikeyan Alagu – Coordinator\n- Bhahirathi – Bahrain & Middle East\n- Chandra – USA\n- Priya – UK\n\nThank you all."

            "description": "The current COVID-19 pandemic has pushed us all into unprecedented tough times and challenges. The lockdown has been a disastrous condition especially for the differently abled workers as most of them depend on daily wages to earn their living. Public transport, tourism and related activities have all been brought to a complete halt, severely affecting the livelihood of thousands, and the visually challenged workers in specific.  The social distancing norms and lockdown regulations have made it impossible for our visually challenged brethren to venture out and carry out their work as they used to. \n\nLit the Light is always keen on empowering and helping our Visually challenged warriors. We realized the need for relief measures and by the last week of March started reaching out to families where a visually challenged person is the primary breadwinner. By the diligent efforts of our volunteers, government officials and friends, the scale of our efforts soon grew from a few dozens to over thousands of relief kits being distributed to 1300 families across Tamil Nadu so far and the mission continues. Each grocery kit we distribute consists of 18 essential items costing around ₹1200. \n\nWe would like to express our heartfelt and sincere gratitude to all the volunteers, IPS and IAS officers who were of great support for the distribution of relief kits and our corporate sponsors for their continued financial support. \n\nOur sponsors Cognizant Outreach, International Justice Mission (IJM), Dreams Alive, Majestic Exports, YIBN and several well-wishers have continued to support us financially and made it possible for us to help through this pandemic situation to be supportive to the visually challenged beneficiaries. \n\nThe major challenge we faced was the safe distribution of the kits amid the social distancing norms. We followed the government guidelines on social distancing and had to avoid direct distribution by volunteers. Thankfully, IPS officers and IAS officers across Tamil Nadu came forward and pitched in their commendable efforts into reaching out and distributing the relief kits in the safest way possible. Our heart goes out for our real heroes who helped us amidst the pandemic. We are also grateful for the Thozhan & ProvokeU Foundation for their efforts into distributing the kits to families across Chennai. \n\nThe lockdown has been ongoing for 5 months with an uncertain future of when the pandemic will ease. Each kit is estimated to last for about a month for an average family. We are trying our best to keep reaching out to the huge number of requests we receive every day.  Our team of volunteers continue to filter the requests, conduct background checks, gather funds and try to reach out to as many families as possible. But it remains a challenge to reach families residing in remote and rural areas.\n We hope to serve as many as possible and keep supporting our differently-abled countrymen during these challenging times. This mission cannot be made possible without your support. Let us come together to support them in their time of need. \n",
